==================
telepathy-qt4-yell
==================

This is a library for Qt-based Telepathy clients. This library adds support for some DRAFT
interfaces that could not land in TelepathyQt4 itself due to API/ABI stability rules.
Once the interfaces are final and the implementation is ready, the code will move to TelepathyQt4
itself and removed from here.

Telepathy is a D-Bus framework for unifying real time communication,
including instant messaging, voice calls and video calls. It abstracts
differences between protocols to provide a unified interface for
applications. See the Telepathy website for more information:

Telepathy specification
=======================

The copy of the Telepathy specification in the spec/ directory indicates
the specification that this library claims to implement. The HTML documentation for the latest version of the specification can be viewed at:

Requirements
============

Building telepathy-qt4-yell requires:
  TelepathyQt4 and its dependencies

See CMakeLists.txt for full details, including versions required.
Of the packages listed above, only QtCore and QtDBus are required at runtime.

Building also requires the cmake build system.

Bugs, feature requests and to-do list
=====================================

Report all bugs, feature requests and "to-do" items here:
  <https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Telepathy&component=tp-qt4>

Running "make check" will produce FIXME.out, which lists all the mentions of
FIXME, TODO or XXX in the source code. Ideally, all of these should be in
Bugzilla, but sometimes they're not.
